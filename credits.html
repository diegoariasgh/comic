<p style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 30px; margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 20px;">We just wanted to thank Roy for his help with the clock, Jiwon for her help with checkLocation() and especially Sarah for her help with everything, from figuring out the story line to the code. 
Lastly, we want to give credit to the author of the poem and the artist who did the illustrations. 
<a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/william-blake">William Blake</a> wrote the poem and did part of the illustrations.
<a href="https://www.biography.com/people/maurice-sendak-9478893">Maurice Sendak</a> is the author of the other illustrations.</p>
